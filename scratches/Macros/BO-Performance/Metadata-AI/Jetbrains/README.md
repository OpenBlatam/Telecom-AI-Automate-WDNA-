# Step 1: Data Gathering
First, you'll need to gather telecom statistics and ticket data. This might involve connecting to the ticket management system or database and extracting relevant data, including ticket descriptions, types, resolutions, and any other relevant features.

# Step 2: Preprocessing the Data
This could involve cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values, etc), extracting features, and converting the data into a format that can be fed into a machine learning or language model.

# Step 3: Training the Model
This is usually done using a machine learning library like PyTorch or Tensorflow. To train a GPT model on your specific task, you will first need to create a custom dataset where each example is a pair of a ticket and its resolution (or any other metric you want the model to learn). This dataset will be used to fine-tune the GPT model to your task.

# Step 4: Evaluating the Model
After training the model, you'll want to test it on an unseen part of the data to evaluate its performance. This will tell you how well the model is likely to perform when deployed and feeding on real-world data.

# Step 5: Deploying the Model
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can deploy it for use in automating telecom statistics and managing tickets. This might involve setting the model up to automatically analyze incoming tickets and suggest solutions, update statistics, or even respond to tickets itself if appropriate.

# Step 6: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
Machine learning models can drift over time as they encounter data that's different from what they were trained on. Therefore, you'll want to continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it on fresh data as necessary to ensure that it continues to perform well.
