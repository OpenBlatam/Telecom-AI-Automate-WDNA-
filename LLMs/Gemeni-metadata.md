While coding a complete prompt engineering solution requires specific details about your chosen LLM and API, here's a framework to get you started with automating RAN alarm tickets using open-source LLMs:

1. Choose an Open-Source LLM:

Popular options include GPT-J (https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b) and Jurassic-1 Jumbo (https://huggingface.co/models?p=136&sort=likes). Explore their capabilities and compatibility with your needs.
2. Leverage Pre-trained Models:

Many open-source LLMs offer pre-trained models focused on specific tasks. Look for models pre-trained on technical documents or telecom data to improve accuracy.

3. Develop the Prompt Structure:

Input: The input should be the RAN alarm data itself. This could include details like:

Cell ID
Alarm code
Alarm severity
Additional diagnostic information
Prompt:

Start by instructing the LLM to "Generate a trouble ticket for the following RAN alarm...".
Include relevant keywords from the alarm data (e.g., Cell ID, Alarm code).
Provide a template for the ticket structure:
Summary: Briefly describe the alarm issue.
Steps to Reproduce: Outline the conditions leading to the alarm.
Severity: Indicate the urgency based on the alarm code.
Possible Root Cause: Leverage the LLM's knowledge to suggest potential causes based on the alarm type.
Suggested Actions: Prompt the LLM to recommend troubleshooting steps or escalate the issue if necessary.
Example Prompt:

Generate a trouble ticket for the following RAN alarm: Cell ID: BTS1234, Alarm Code: RRC_CONNECTION_FAILURE, Severity: High.

Summary: The cell is experiencing issues establishing Radio Resource Control connections.

Steps to Reproduce: (Prompt the LLM to analyze the data and suggest steps)

Severity: High (Critical impact on network functionality)

Possible Root Cause: (Prompt the LLM to analyze the data and suggest potential causes)

Suggested Actions: (Prompt the LLM to recommend troubleshooting steps or suggest escalation)

4. Integration with Ticketing System API:

Utilize libraries like requests in Python to connect to your ticketing system API.
Once the LLM generates the ticket content based on the prompt and alarm data, use the API to submit the ticket automatically.
5. Training and Improvement:

Gather real RAN alarm data with corresponding manually created tickets.
Fine-tune the LLM with these paired datasets to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated tickets.
Remember: This is a starting point. You'll need to adapt it to your specific LLM, API, and desired ticket format. Consider consulting the documentation for your chosen LLM and ticketing system API for detailed integration instructions.
