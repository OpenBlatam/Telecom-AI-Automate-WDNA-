# How to setup your own GPT of the AI input ouput that you want to generate

Training a large language model like GPT-3, the model that powers chatGPT, requires a lot of computational power and specialized hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). 
Once the model is trained, however, it can be run on a less powerful computer, such as a personal computer or a server with a fast CPU and enough memory to handle the model's calculations. 
The specific hardware requirements for running a trained model would depend on the size of the model and the specific tasks you want to perform with it. It may be more practical to use chatGPT 
through its web interface, which allows you to access the model without having to set up your own hardware.




# Limitations 


Whe is too big
Due to the large size of the model (314B parameters), a multi-GPU machine is required to test the model with the example code.
