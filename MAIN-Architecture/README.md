Brainstorms ideas:


Without specs

Basically to hackathon idea to copy and paste to auto execute commands of get and post the ideas in pre post tx of data

Components:

Django libraries for framewoork web stuff
RPA
LLMS 
Agents

Combine is a frankiesten of different computations that recreate the excel architectures auto execute to remedy 
Principals external components:


Redemy 
WDNA
Gestors
Another networks
MAT
MACROS



General thread:


There is some graphics and stuff that is only n + 1 and n - 1 postions for run automate(macro, framework) stuff
 is there posible create a LLMS, AI ML nad other stuff for run the independe form

example:


Give the kpi some dates for a specific INC , more n + 1 queries that could run for specific projects 


Creating such an application involves creating a frontend interface where users can enter commands, using AI model to process these commands, and finally, executing them. For the frontend part, you can create a web interface using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the backend, you can use Flask or Django to create an API.
However, there is a serious security concern about executing code based on user-provided inputs, even if the inputs have been processed by an AI model like GPT-3, due to the risk of arbitrary code execution.
An safer alternative is to use the AI model to understand the intent of the user's command, and then have a predefined set of secure actions which can be executed based on the intent. In this case, for the command "plot x", the AI can understand that the user wants to plot a variable named "x", and then calls a safe function to generate this plot.

User Input: Where the user enters commands for the system.
Command Interpreter(OpenAI GPT-3): Interpretation of user commands using GPT-3.
OpenAI Wrapper(Python openai package): Wrapper to interact with the OpenAI API.
Command Router (Python dict): Used to map user commands to the functions that carry out those commands.
Data Store (Pandas DataFrame): Store various data sets loaded from CSV files.
Action Handlers (Python funcs): Functions that carry out actions based on the user's commands.
Data Visualization and Statistical Computation (matplotlib, numpy): Functions for plotting data and calculating statistics like mean, median, etc.
Output: This is where the results of user commands are printed for the user to see.

Issue:
he actual implementation will largely depend on how your datasets and plotting functions are set up.
This may involve complex Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tasks.
