To create a new machine learning pipeline, which would combine functionality of the distributed training using PyTorch with a similar approach you showed for the Linear Regression, the following steps can be followed:
Parallelize the Linear Regression model, in this case we would likely use a SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) variant, as it's suitable for distributed settings.
Using distributed data loading, similar to what's done with the VidCLIP model in the training script you shared; train_loaders and val_loaders could be used to split the dataset for training and validation purposes respectively.
Call the start_training function, while passing the Linear Regression model (implemented for distributed systems) and the handlers for the training and testing loaders.
IMORTANT: Note that this would not be a drop-in replacement as PyTorch does not natively support Linear Regression across distributed systems. You will need to engineer a workaround for this by possibly splitting the data across the workers manually and then gathering the individual results.
